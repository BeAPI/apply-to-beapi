# Apply To BeAPI
This is a project in order to check candidate's WordPress level. 

# Purpose
There is no pressure ! just a simple way to highlight a candidate WordPress knowledge. It's also mostly a way see how candidate is coding, organizing, using different tools, etc.

There are 3 levels :
* [Easy](https://github.com/BeAPI/apply-to-beapi/tree/master/wp-content/themes/easy)
* Medium
* Hard

# How To Do
Each level is represented by a theme inside `wp-content/themes/` folder where there is a readme which describes you what to do.

Please make a fork and work inside your project with as much commits as possible to describe what you are doing.

GOOD LUCK !
